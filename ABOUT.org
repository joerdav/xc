#+TITLE: About using =xc= with org-mode

When using =xc= with =org-mode=, it looks in the current directory (then in parents) for a =README.org= and treats sub-headers under the "Tasks" header as tasks. You can specify a different file with the =file= flag, i.e. ~xc -file FILENAME~.

/Note: in a directory that contains both =README.org= and =README.md=, =xc= will look for tasks in the Markdown README only./
You can change this using the =type= flag, i.e. ~xc -type org TASK~

** org-mode specific features

=xc= provides these features for your convenience:

*** Comment headings
=xc= will skip over =org-mode= [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Comment-Lines.html][comment headings]] beginning with =COMMENT=.
*** Header tags
When =xc= looks for tasks, it expects to find them under a header called =Tasks=. To override this, you can put an =:xc_heading:= [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html][tag]] on any heading and =xc= will find tasks under the first such heading it encounters. Here's what this looks like in practice, supposing you want to use "Getting started" as your task heading:
#+begin_example org
  ,** Getting started                                              :xc_heading:
  ,*** build
      [...etc]
#+end_example
